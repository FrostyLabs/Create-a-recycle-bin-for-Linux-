# Create-a-recycle-bin-for-Linux-
This was the coursework set to us by Napier University. Our task was to create a recycle bin for Linux systems. 

the del file creates a recyclebin if there is none present, and will put files there. Will not permanently delete them. 
The restore file takes files out of the recycle bin and places them in their original spot
